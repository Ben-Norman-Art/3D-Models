<p style="color:white">These past projects are some I made during my time in the Art Program when I was in high school. These are what made me want to focus on and pursue the 3D modeling world as well as Game Design. The 3D models I made in the past were originally made through the application Cinema 4D. I soon was able to surpass many other applications such as Blender and Fusion 360. I am currently learning how to use the Adobe Dimensions making it possible to understand another 3D modeling application.

<p style="color:white">When people see the 3D models that I make, I want them to see the different worlds that are able to be created. With these art pieces another aspect I want to represent is the improvements of understanding some of the aspects of 3D modeling. A lot of my pieces are made through inspirations from mythological stories and artifacts from a story that I helped create. With this I was able to bring some of these stories and artifacts to life with these 3D models.
